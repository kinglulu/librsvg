TODO:

 * Clipping paths

 * Masks

 * Fixing image transforms

 * Image effects/filters

 * Fill patterns

 * Add actual GError support in the loader, rather then the g_warnings
   that we currently use.

 * Allow affine's other than scaling (we do this already, da?)

On the back burner:

 * Consider storing the paths so that the file can be rerendered
   multiple times without reparsing.

 * Make error messages translatable (requires adding gettext).
