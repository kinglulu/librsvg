librsvg 2.11

This release of librsvg is the result of 6 months of development. Caleb Moore 
spent a lot of time reorganizing the code to enable adding DOM support to librsvg. 
This code reorganisation had a lot of other positive side effects too, like improved 
stability and consitency, and last but not least improved rendering speed.

There is also a great host of rendering fixes by Caleb to things like gradient positioning, 
patterns, namespaces, inheritance, marker rendering and text rendering. Also 
in this release is better clip paths handling and handling of out of order 
references and other file references.

Dom Lachowicz have worked on full support for conditionals and made vfs support 
work better in addition to merging patches and bugfixing.

1. rsvg cannot handle a relative path (309234) - Josselin Mouette
